## **what is this thing?**

this project was a way to help someone who owns a OpenShock shocker to give shocking reminders to themselves (or others) of things they need to do on a day to day basis.

have trouble waking up at a "reasonable" time everyday? this project can help with that.

want to get better at staying hydrated while you spend hours at a time gaming everyday? this project can also help with that.

please note: this project does use functions specific to the rpi pico sdk, meaning its not multi-platform.

## **setting up the dev environment**
please refer to [this](https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/platformio.html).

## **getting started**
please see [this](docs/getting%20started.md) for info on getting started.

## **future plans for this project**

please see [this](todo.md)
  
## **why does your code look so weird?**
when i originally started this project, i gave myself the following challenge:

* use no uppercase letters in any part of the code, ie functions, classes, variables, etc. (excluding code i didn't write, like functions from libraries)

over the coarse of this project, the challenge turned into:

* use no uppercase letters in any part of the code, ie functions, classes, variables, etc. (excluding code i didn't write, like functions from libraries)
* use no uppercase letters in any part of the documentation (excluding names)
* use no uppercase letters in any part of the webpages (excluding names)

i'm well aware this challenge makes everything look kinda cursed.

## **contributing**
please feel free to submit pull requests, i just ask that you follow the challenge set out above. contributers will be credited for their work below.

## **special thanks**

* Earle F. Philhower, III (creator and maintainer of the [arduino-pico core](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico))
* Maximilian Gerhardt (for creating the [arduino-pico platform.io integration](https://github.com/maxgerhardt/platform-raspberrypi/tree/develop))
* my wonderful partner (for inspiring me to do this project, encouraging me to not give up (even though i really wanted to a couple times), and supporting this endeavor. love you hon!)
* a small handfull of people (leaving them unnamed until i get the courage to ask if its ok to name them) on the OpenShock discord server (for thinking this was a cool idea when i was extremely nervous about releasing it) 

## **attribution/license**

i have no plan on licensing this work. feel free to do whatever you want with this project.

it would be nice if any works created from this had a link back to this repo, but it isn't something you have to do.

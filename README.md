## **What is this thing?**

this project was a way to help someone who owns a OpenShock shocker to give shocking reminders to themselves (or others) of things they need to do on a day to day basis.

Have trouble waking up at a "reasonable" time everyday? This project can help with that.

Want to get better at staying hydrated while you spend hours at a time gaming everyday? This project can also help with that.

## **Setting up the dev environment**
Please refer to [this](https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/platformio.html)

## **Getting started**
please see [this](docs/getting%20started.md) for info on getting started.

## **Future plans for this project**

* ability to set certain tasks to only run on certain days of the week/certain days of the month
* support for daylight saving time (if applicable in your part of the world)
* some sort of gui for configuring? (maybe something similar to the OpenShock captive portal?) (need help with)
* custom pcb for this project, the current prototype is built on protoboard.
